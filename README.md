## Overview

This repository contains the solutions for the Embedded Software Engineer Quiz. The quiz consists of two questions:

1. Cutting a rectangular piece of paper into the largest possible squares using C.
2. Analyzing a spreadsheet to find a function that maps inputs to outputs using Python.

## Q1: Cutting Squares from Paper

The C program `cut_squares.c` cuts a rectangular piece of paper into the largest possible squares. The program takes two integers, `N` and `M`, representing the dimensions of the paper, and prints the sizes of the squares.

### Running the C Program

To compile and run the C program, use the following commands:

```sh
gcc cut_squares.c -o cut_squares
./cut_squares
